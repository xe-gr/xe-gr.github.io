Helping our customers find what they are looking for easily, quickly and unambiguously is the sole most important factor that influences what we do in Engineering at Xrysi Eukairia. Areas of focus of our engineers are developing high traffic and always-on web applications specialized in classifieds, optimizing code to run faster and adding features that make the journey of our customers easier. Almost all of our systems are running in the AWS cloud and we make extensive use of AWS services.

We do not believe that working overtime is more productive. We keep a sustainable, normal working hours schedule. We also don't want our team to be constrained by h/w, so our workstations are typically top notch (laptops with powerful i7s, 32 GB RAM, M.2 disks and dual 24'' monitors when working in the company headquarters).

By far the largest part of our back end stack is Java but lately we added C# to our arsenal. We recently used Rails to redesign our Jobs vertical and our front-facing applications will gradually be redesigned and migrated to use a Rails/React stack. For streaming and processing data we lean on Python and make heavy use of AWS. In our application servers one finds Tomcat and Apache but we also use RabbitMQ, MySql, Redis, Memcached and MongoDB. During our daily life we make heavy use of JetBrains and Atlassian tools. When we push releases to staging or production, we use Jenkins for our CI/CD pipeline. But we may occasionally also push [serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) directly from IntelliJ and Visual Studio.

We've been coding for the last 15 years so bumping on the occasional piece of legacy code is unavoidable - however, we've been working diligently towards making our systems work in a loosely coupled manner and breaking up pieces of functionality to micro services that are easier to understand and maintain. Most of our services are for internal use but some are public and accessible from our customers as you can see in our [developers page](https://developers.xe.gr/).

Since the unfortunate outbreak of COVID-19 we've boosted our remote working capabilities. Currently almost everyone in engineering is working remotely for a considerable part of their time in order to enable full social distancing.
