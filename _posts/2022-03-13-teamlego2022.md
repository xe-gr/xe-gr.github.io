## Round #2
Last May we run our [Team Lego initiative](https://www.xe.gr/careers/team-lego){:target="_blank"} which turned out to be [a success](https://xe-gr.github.io/2021-08-06-teamlegoinitiative/){:target="_blank"} and exceeded our expectations. Unsurprisingly, we'll be running the same initiative this year again and will start accepting applications in mid-May. The process will be pretty much the same - the only change we might do is slightly change the format and options of the online test.

## How is the team doing so far
Here's how the developers of the Team Lego initiative were divided:
* Seven are part of the web stack, working with Ruby on Rails and React.
* Five are part of the backend stack, working mostly with Java and AWS.
* Three are part of the mobile team, all working with Android.
* Two are part of the data team, working on data engineering and data science.

The last three months have probably been hectic for the new developers since they got exposed to the full blast of our production systems. Part of our Q1 IT [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR){:target="_blank"} have been these directives, aimed specifically towards helping our new colleagues:
* _Ensure that there are opportunities for pairing with more experienced team members every week._
* _Guide new team members towards being able to work with the team and not primarily the team leader._
* _Every new member must be able to deploy and monitor part of their team infrastructure without assistance by the end of the quarter._
* _Ensure that new team members get a good balance of maintenance tasks and new feature tasks._
